# EzSpeaky

EzSpeaky is designed for parents whose children with cleft lip and cleft palate need access to speech therapy methods. This web app includes speech therapy videos from youtube in the following:
1. Speech emission
2. Articulation
3. Air flow

Parents have access to a comment box in each therapy type to record the progress in the therapy.

## User Stories

- As a user I want to see the types of therapies I need to follow with my child/student to correct speech problems in my child.
- As a user I want to access a therapy type to see videos that correspond to the therapy.
- As a user I want to be able to add comments to the therapy type to record progress and completion.
- As a user I want to be able to delete comments to avoid confusion on progress and to avoid clutter in my therapy type.

## Approach

The approach taken to develop this web app was to base my app features from the user stories created.
I identified the view states and the components needed for each one.
Most of the app is content provided and the user is only given the opportunity to create a comment to track progress ont he therapies and exercises provided.
- Identify routes
- Identify components
- Bindings
- Actions


## EzSpeaky to be

EzSpeaky will have a better look and it will include options for the user to delete comments.
I would really like to create the therapies myself with like games or some sort of card interaction, to make it more interactive for kids and their parents.

## Major hurdles

- Creating the comment to bind to the therapy. After many hours and the help of our consultant Jeff Horn, developers Wei, Lauren, and Sam; I was bale to get the comment feature to work. Thanks a lot!!!
